# imc-basic-javascript

A basics BMI (IMC on portuguese) calculation using a simple **pure javascript** to practice skills with it.

<br>

On this project I used the concept of:
- document (DOM) and manipulate it
  - createElement
  - appendChild
  - querySelector and querySelectorAll
  - classList and classList.add()
  - innerHTML
- functions
- for and forEach
- addEventListener and event.preventDefault()
- forms and validations
- **RegExp** to search a name on out list
- setTimout
- and more...

<br>

This project is only to practice the skills that we forget when are using frameworks and more. <br>
This training is a part of the **Alura's course**.
